// Utility Types

/*

  TypeScript utility types are predefined constructs that facilitate common type transformations, enhancing code flexibility and maintainability.

  They allow developers to modify existing types easily, such as by making properties optional or read-only.
  Utility types help in creating more expressive and concise type definitions, reducing redundancy in code.
