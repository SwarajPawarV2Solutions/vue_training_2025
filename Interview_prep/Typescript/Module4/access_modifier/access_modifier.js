// Access Modifier
// An access modifier is a keyword that defines the visibility and accessibility of class members (properties and methods) in object-oriented programming. In TypeScript, access modifiers are used to control how and where the members of a class can be accessed or modified. They provide a mechanism for encapsulation, allowing developers to restrict access to the internal state and behavior of a class, ensuring that it can only be interacted with in specific ways.
// Types of Access Modifiers in TypeScript: -> Public, Private and Protected
// Purpose od Access Modifier
// Access modifiers help to manage how data and methods are exposed or protected in a class, ensuring that the internal workings of a class are hidden from the outside world unless explicitly intended to be exposed. This is a key aspect of encapsulation, which is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.
// public -> 	Accessible anywhere (inside and outside the class).
// private -> 	Accessible only within the class where it is defined.
// protected -> 	Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
