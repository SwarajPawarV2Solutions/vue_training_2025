// State Management

// State management in Vue 3 is a way to manage and share data across different parts of your application. It helps you store the data (or state) that needs to be accessed or changed in multiple components, and makes it easier to keep everything in sync.

/*
   Imagine youâ€™re building a shopping cart for an online store. You need to manage things like:

How many items are in the cart.
The total price of the items in the cart.
Whether the cart is empty or has products.
In a small app, you might store this data (state) in a component, but as the app grows and you have many components, it becomes harder to share this data between them. State management helps solve this problem by providing a central place to store this data and make sure all parts of the app can access or update it when needed.
