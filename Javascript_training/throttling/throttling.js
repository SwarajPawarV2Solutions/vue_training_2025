// Throttling in JavaScript

// Throttling is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed. It is particularly useful in situations where a function is being triggered continuously, but we want to limit how often it actually runs.

// Imagine a function that gets called every time a user scrolls a page. Without throttling, the function might get called hundreds or thousands of times per second, leading to performance issues.


/*

Why is Throttling Used?

Throttling is used to:

1. Improve performance: Reduces the frequency of function calls and prevents performance bottlenecks.
2. Prevent overloading resources: Some functions can be computationally expensive (like network requests or DOM manipulation). Throttling ensures they don't run too frequently.
3. Manage event listeners: Events like scrolling, resizing, or mouse movements can fire too frequently, and throttling helps you manage how often your handler executes.

 Applications of Throttling


1. Scroll Events:

  * When you track user scroll position or load more content as the user scrolls, throttling can prevent performance    degradation.
  * Example: Infinite scrolling (loading content as the user scrolls down).
  
  
2. Resize Events:

  * When a window is resized, a resize event can be fired very frequently. Throttling helps reduce the frequency of event handler calls.
  * Example: Recalculating layouts or resizing elements based on window size.
   
  
3. Mouse Movement Tracking:

  * For performance reasons, it's important to throttle event listeners that track mouse movements (like showing a tooltip or interactive feature).
  * Example: Implementing an interactive game or tracking user's mouse position on the page.
   
  
4. API Requests:

  * When making API calls that are triggered by events like typing (auto-suggestions), you may want to throttle requests to prevent sending too many requests in a short time.
  * Example: Search auto-complete feature where requests are throttled as the user types.
