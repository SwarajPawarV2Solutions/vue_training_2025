//Problem is every Http request takes time to download. so to reduce Amount of Http request so we use webpack

// Webpack is the tool that will help us bundle our files together. Webpack is a Bundling & " Build Orchestration" Tool. Its a tool that helps us reduce the amount of http request by bundling code together so that we write code split up across multiple files but webpack then takes all these files and bundles them together


// At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.
