Examples of built-in Data types

let a: null = null; 


let b: number = 123; 


let c: number = 123.456; 


let d: string = ‘Swaraj’; 


let e: undefined = undefined; 


let f: boolean = true; 


let g: number = 0b111001; // Binary 


let h: number = 0o436; // Octal 


let i: number = 0xadf0d; // Hexa-Decimal

/*

Examples of user defined Data type

any: is a special data-type, also the super data-type of all data types. If a variable is declared with any data type then we can assign any type value to that variable.

Examples:


let a: any = null; 


let b: any =123; 


let c: any = 123.456; 


let d: any = ‘Swaraj’; 


let e: any = undefined; 


let f: any = true;
